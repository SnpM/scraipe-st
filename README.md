# scraipe-st

This is the Streamlit GUI demo for the Scraipe library.

## (Optional) Preconfigure Credentials
To pre-configure scraper and analyzer credentials, set the following environment variables:

```
TELEGRAM_API_ID
TELEGRAM_API_HASH
OPENAI_API_KEY
GEMINI_API_KEY
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET
```

Additionally, `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` and `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET` must be preconfigured to "Add Reddit Links"; otherwise, the button will do nothing.
